The columns include Product ID, Sales, Category, Size, Price, Rating, and Repeat Purchase. The dataset is relatively clean, with no missing values, except for the Rating column. However, some columns may contain incorrect data. The dataset comprises of three data types: integer, object, and float, and some columns may need to be casted to a different data type for further analysis.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"370d1f60-f7d3-44a8-bd7c-54ac44514e80"},{"source":"## DATA VALIDATION\n\n","metadata":{"jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed":true,"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Based on the resources given, data se was cleaned to adhere to the standards. Some techniques used involved replacing values, casting data type,and fixing incorrect data entries to ensure the datset matched what was expected. Here are the result\n- The **rating** columns contains values between 1-10. 150 null values were discovered. To remedy this, the missing values were replaced with 0 as dictated by the documentation.\n- The **product_id** column had 1500 values with no duplicates,missing value and had the proper data type.\n- The **category** column contained 7 categories with one being '-' instead of 6 categories containing equipment,food,toys,medicine,housing, and accessory.25 Values that were given _'-'_ were classfied as missing values and was replaced with unknown.\n- The **animal** category checked out the data validation list with four categories:Cat,fish,dog, and bird.\n- The **size** column contained 9 categories which did not match with the expected 3 categories. Further analysis showed that this was due to inconsistencies in size name. some were written in either  camel case,lower or upper case.To fix this, they were all converted to lower case leaving the column with 3 values(small,medium and large) as expected.\n- The **price** column had values of different data type. The minimum value of the column was checked to ensure there wereno negative values.The column had 150 field with string value _\"unlisted\"_.\tThis was replaced with the median price of the dataset.\tTo resolve the data type issue, the column was converted to float64 and then rounded to two decimal places.\n- The **sales** column checked out with validation. Only changes made was rounding it to two decimal places.\n- The **repeat_purchase** column had no null values and was categorised into 1 and 0 as expected.","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## REPEAT PURCHASES ACROSS CATEGORIES","metadata":{},"id":"643d4c36-4183-4fbe-a263-6b9de60d29da","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"- ## How often do repeat purchases happen?\n- ## What is the proportion of repeat purchase observations in each category of the variable?","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a8306bf9-a932-4584-95a9-b2c6e57ca19a"},{"source":"![count_repeat_purchase](count_repeat_purchase.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dc610b00-1685-4720-b437-2441e05d4ebb"},{"source":"The data analysis of the store's purchases shows a significant trend of repeat customers, with **906**out of **1500** purchases being repeat purchases.This represents **60%** of the total purchases. Among the different product categories, equipment has the highest rate of purchases, accounting for **24.4%** of total purchases. Furthermore, equipment is also the most popular category, with **370** purchases in total. An in-depth analysis of the ratio of repeat purchases to total purchases shows that customers who purchase **housing** products have the highest rate of repeat purchases at **66.9%** of total housing purchases, followed by customers who purchase **medicine** at **64.5%** of total medicine purchase. **Equipment** comes in third with a repeat purchase rate of **59.7%** of total equipment purchases. These findings suggest that customers have a strong tendency to return to the store for repeat purchases for medicine, housing and equipmentts while accessories has the lowest purchases as well as repeat purchases.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0aa24c4a-68a5-4b84-8695-e33ad84f6b2c"},{"source":"![Purchase_per_category](Purchase_per_category.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d21a37ad-9b90-4cd0-8ad9-e6b49a92a81c"},{"source":"## How are all sales distributed?","metadata":{},"id":"ce5f6df2-fbf2-4c44-9209-9ee668876b53","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"- The **equipment** category brings in the biggest sales followed by Toys and Food.Equipment makes up **23%** of total sales\n- Products with ratings between 3 to 6 brings in the highest number of sales with **6** making **20%** of total sales.

The same can be said for the size small.\n- Furthermore, it can be seen that equipment products generate substantial sales due to their high purchase frequency. Additionally, toys, which are the third most frequently purchased category, also tend to generate more sales. On the other hand, smaller products such as housing and medicine have a relatively higher proportion of repeat purchases.\n- Looking at ratings, products rated 6 bring in the highest sales yet,those rated 4  have the highest repeated purchase by a small margin.\n- It can be inferred from the data that repeat purchases do not have a significant impact on sales, and the variables with the highest number of sales do not necessarily mean they have the highest number of repeat purchases. \n- Furthermore, it implies that other factors such as product size, animal type, and product category are more influential in determining sales.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c2319413-bf9c-4262-b429-3a213fd42a42"},{"source":"## âœ… When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
